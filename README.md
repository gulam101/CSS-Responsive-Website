### Description:

This is a single responsive page design that just shows off some features that I had learnt in CSS and HTML. This point of this project was to make sure that the user can interacte with the page in mobile design. I had fun with this project because I took a break from the testing and had fun developing.

There are a few things that I need to finish off but other than that I am happy creating this project.


### Prerequisites:
- Any Modern Browser (Preferably Chrome or Firefox)
- Any IDE to view code (Preferably Atom or Brackets)
- Access to developer tools on web browser

### What I Learnt:
- Using Input keyword in CSS
- Different ways of creating animations in CSS
- Understanding Unicode
- JavaScript (Hamburger menu icon)

### Constraints:

I had problems creating the footer because when I tried to use the columns for it, it kept on centering it in a different position.

Also in a certain height the video seems to overlap other elements and cause the user to scroll to the the webpage/
