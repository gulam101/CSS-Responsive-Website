### Description:

This is a single responsive page design that just shows off some features that I had learnt in CSS and HTML. This point of this project was to make sure that the user can interact with the page in mobile design. I had fun with this project because I took a break from the testing and had fun developing. I also practised my knowledge on HTML and CSS and if I ever need to create something then I can always refer to this project. I used this a learning curve and hopefully keep on building projects that will enhance my knowledge.

The user can interact with the menu bar and if they hover over the menu, it will change the text colour and it changes it within 0.3 seconds. If the user tries to click on the other options, it wonâ€™t work because I wanted to create a single page that is responsive and that I can refer to in case I forget anything in HTML. If the user switches into mobile view then they can also see that the menu disappears, except for the home button, and the hamburger menu icon will show. 

The hamburger menu icon will show the rest of the options in the menu. It was created using JavaScript using the script function. I also had fun play animations across certain areas on the webpage and my plan is to create an animation for the menu on the hamburger icon so that it plays a cool animation.

There are a few things that I need to finish off but other than that I am happy creating this project. I did have fun and have learned a lot of new techniques that I didn't know 


### Prerequisites:
- Any Modern Browser (Preferably Chrome or Firefox)
- Any IDE to view code (Preferably Atom or Brackets)
- Access to developer tools on web browser

### What I Learnt:
- Using Input keyword in CSS
- Different ways of creating animations in CSS
- Understanding Unicode
- JavaScript (Hamburger menu icon)

Overall, I had learned quite a few things and have a better understanding when it comes to creating a project that would be similar. I can take what I have learned and put it into a different project so that I can improve what I know. It does seem like I have a lot to learn and can't wait to dive into another project, so that I can pick up on new skills.

### Constraints:

I had problems creating the footer because when I tried to use the columns for it, it kept on centering it in a different position.

Also in a certain height the video seems to overlap other elements and cause the user to scroll to the the webpage/
